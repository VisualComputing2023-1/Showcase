I am an 8th semester Computer Engineering student at the INSA Rennes in France, currently doing an exchange at the National University of Colombia. Both interested in Virtual Reality and sustainable development in computer science, I would like to link these two subjects in my professional life. Since Visual Computing can, for exemple, lead to a better understanding of one of these themes by bringing me more knowledge on the visualization of images in computer science, I would hope of it to make me practice on that theme.

<!--Welcome to the [gohugo](https://gohugo.io/) template to create rich content [academic reports](https://www.wordy.com/writers-workshop/writing-an-academic-report/) having [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) sketches.

## Hacking 2

Create a github [user account](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/signing-up-for-github/signing-up-for-a-new-github-account) or [organization](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/collaborating-with-groups-in-organizations/creating-a-new-organization-from-scratch), and install [git](https://git-scm.com/) and the [gohugo](https://gohugo.io/) [static site generator](https://jamstack.org/generators/) then:

1. Create a new repo [from this template](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template#creating-a-repository-from-a-template) into your user account or organization. **Don't rename the repo but leave it as 'showcase'**.
2. Grant [read and write permissions](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/enabling-features-for-your-repository/managing-github-actions-settings-for-a-repository#configuring-the-default-github_token-permissions) to your newly created repo workflow.
3. [Clone](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository) your newly created repo and `cd` into your repo root: `$cd showcase`.
4. Install the site default theme: `$git submodule update --init --recursive`.
5. Redefined `baseURL` in `config.toml` to point to your site url, i.e., https://*username*.github.io/showcase/ where *username* is your username (or organization name) on GitHub. Refer to [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) for details about url naming conventions. **Don't forget to [commit](https://github.com/git-guides/git-commit) your changes**.

Render your site locally: `$hugo server -D --disableFastRender`.

Deploy with `$git push`. Don't forget to select the `gh-pages` branch as the one to serve your site from at the [pages section of your repo configuration page](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-your-github-pages-site).

### Remark

{{< hint info >}}
The **showcase** template uses the [hugo-book](https://github.com/alex-shpak/hugo-book) theme by default. Check the [hugo themes site](https://themes.gohugo.io/) if you wish to add other ones.
