Definition of subtractive/additive color models

## Additive color models

An additive color model is a model formed by the combination of coincident component lights, starting with blackness. In this model, the three primary colors are red, green and blue.

It corresponds to color produced by a combination of different lights.

{{< tab "RGB" >}}
# RGB
RGB content
The RGB color model allows to define colors thanks to three values defining respectively the quantity of red, green and blue for the defined colour.


This is a device-dependent color model

## Subtractive color models

A substractive color model is a model formed by the combination of lights after passing through succesive layers of absorbing components. It is called like that because a certain material substracts that colors RGB from a white/clear background (= it removes portions of the visible spectrum). In this colour model, the primary colors are cyan, magenta and yellow.

It generally corresponds to color produced when printing, photographying, drawing, ...

# CMYK
The CMYK (Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, Black) color model is used to describe the printing process. It works by masking colors on a lighter background (as printing on a white paper, for example).

## Combination of subtractive and additive color models

The two following models, HSL and HSB, are combinations of an additive and a substractive color model.

{{< tab "HSL model" >}}
# HSL model
HSL stands for Hue, Saturation and Lightness.

{{< tab "HSB model" >}}
# HSB model
HSB stands for Hue, Saturation and Brightness. It is the equivalent to HSV, which stands for Hue, Saturation and Value.
